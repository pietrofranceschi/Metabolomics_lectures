## {.flexbox .vcenter}

~~**Start from a clear question**~~


## Quantify analytical variability {.build}

> * What is the best strategy to quench metabolism?
> * What is the best way to extract my samples?
> * **MS performance degrade with time**: how long can I run my sample list before cleaning
> * **Block** your experimental design on the analytical batch 
> * Reduce as much as possible the length of the chromatographic run

##

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
sample_list <- tibble(batch = rep(c("Batch 1","Batch 2"), each = 20),
                      class = rep(c("treated","control"), each = 20),
                      order = rep(1:20, times = 2)) %>% 
  mutate(random_class = sample(class))

class.labs <- c("non random","random")
names(class.labs) <- c("class","random_class")


sample_list %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_longer(contains("class")) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(y = batch, x = order, fill = value), pch = 21, size = 3) + 
  facet_wrap(~name, labeller = labeller(name = class.labs)) + 
  theme_bw() + xlab("Injection Order") + ylab("") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Sample Class") + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 0.5, legend.position = "bottom")

```



## Quality Contro Samples (QC) {.build}

> Reference samples should be regularly injected along the sequence.  

> They measure analytical stability because the sample itself is the same.

> QC samples should be representative of the chamical complexity of the samples

> **Pooled samples** are often the preferred choice


## 

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.align="center"}

tibble(order = 1:14,
       sample = c("blank","QC","QC","QC",rep(c("S","S","S","S","QC"), times = 2))) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(y = 1, x = order, fill = sample), pch = 21, size = 4) +
  theme_bw() + xlab("Injection Order") + ylab("") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Sample Class") + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 0.5, legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.y = element_blank() )

```

* The usefulness of blanks is disputed
* The first repeated QCs are use to allow column equilibration
* One could add QC dilutions
* Also the design of the sequence can be validated


## DDA and Fragmentation

```{r out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("../images/tandemMS.jpg")
```

Experiment combining full scan and fragmentation experiment are quite popular, because fragmentation patterns are needed for metabolite annotation


## Use wisely your time

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=12, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
x <- seq(1, 15, length=40)
y <- dnorm(x, mean = 10, sd = 1)

par(mfrow = c(1,3))
plot(x,y, type = "l", xlab = "time", ylab = "I", main = "Only FS")
points(x,y, col = "steelblue", pch = 19)
points(x,y, col = "steelblue", type = "h")
polygon(x,y, col = "#4682B450", border = NA)
legend("topleft", legend = c("FS","DDA"), lty = 1, col = c("steelblue", "orange"))

plot(x,y, type = "l", xlab = "time", ylab = "I", main = "FS + 1DDA")
points(x[seq(1,100,2)],y[seq(1,100,2)], col = "steelblue", pch = 19)
points(x[seq(1,100,2)],y[seq(1,100,2)], col = "steelblue", type = "h")
points(x[seq(2,100,2)],y[seq(2,100,2)], col = "orange", pch = 19)
points(x[seq(2,100,2)],y[seq(2,100,2)], col = "orange", type = "h")
polygon(x[seq(1,100,2)],y[seq(1,100,2)], col = "#4682B450", border = NA)


plot(x,y, type = "l", xlab = "time", ylab = "I", main = "FS + 3DDA")
points(x[seq(1,100,4)],y[seq(1,100,4)], col = "steelblue", pch = 19)
points(x[seq(1,100,4)],y[seq(1,100,4)], col = "steelblue", type = "h")
points(x[seq(2,100,4)],y[seq(2,100,4)], col = "orange", pch = 19)
points(x[seq(2,100,4)],y[seq(2,100,4)], col = "orange", type = "h")
points(x[seq(3,100,4)],y[seq(3,100,4)], col = "orange", pch = 19)
points(x[seq(3,100,4)],y[seq(3,100,4)], col = "orange", type = "h")
points(x[seq(4,100,4)],y[seq(4,100,4)], col = "orange", pch = 19)
points(x[seq(4,100,4)],y[seq(4,100,4)], col = "orange", type = "h")
polygon(x[seq(1,100,4)],y[seq(1,100,4)], col = "#4682B450", border = NA)

```

The more experiments I do, the worst is my estimate of the peak area ...

* plan different runs for FS and DDA
* fragment only ion of interest
* strike a balance between chromatography, instrument speed and number of experiments
