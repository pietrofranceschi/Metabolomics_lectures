## Statistics

**Statistics** is the science which deals with **the collection, the analysis, the visualization and the interpretation** of experimental data.


## How data are collected ...



<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">

* Random samplings
* Observational studies
* Experiments

</div>
  <div style="flex: 1;">
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
  include_graphics("../images/picking_flowers.png")
```
  </div>
</div>



## Random Samplings (polls)

<div style="border: 2px solid #e74c3c; background-color: #fdecea; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  ⚠️ <strong>Definition:</strong> <br> Random samplings allow to characterize the properties of a finite population without measuring all of its members.
</div>

<br><br>

**Examples**

* *Electoral polls*
* *Normal levels of cholesterol in the human population*
* *Characterization of a population of grapes, apples, wines, ...*
* ...

## Observational Studies

<div style="border: 2px solid #e74c3c; background-color: #fdecea; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  ⚠️ <strong>Definition:</strong> <br> Observational studies are designed with the objective of **identifying relationships** between the different properties of a conceptual population. The role of the experimenter is to perform the **selection of the sample**.
</div>

<br><br>

**Examples**

* *Is it true that people who eat more chocolate are more happy?*
* *The level of cholesterol of people eating more vegetables is lower*
...

## Experiments

<div style="border: 2px solid #e74c3c; background-color: #fdecea; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  ⚠️ <strong>Definition:</strong> <br> **Experiments** are designed with the objective of identifying **causal relations** between the properties of a conceptual population. The role of the experimenter is to **modify the conditions** to verify the presence of causal relationship between the observed properties.
</div>

<br><br>

**Examples**

* *If you eat more chocolate you will get happier*
* *If I drink more beer I'll get more sympathetic*
*  ...


## Important notes

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">

* Causal relations can be assessed only in **experiments**
* This is really Galileian ;-)
* Experiments are impossible in many relevant fields like human health and ecology

  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1;">
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="70%"}
  include_graphics("../images/fieldnotes.jpg")
```
  </div>
</div>

`r text_spec("Should we then give up on obtaining causal information there?", color = "red")`


## Mind the chocolate ... 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
  include_graphics("../images/chocolate.png")
```

<div style="font-size: 0.5em;text-align: right;">
*New England Journal of Medicine, 2012*
</div>

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
*" ... Chocolate consumption enhances cognitive function, which is a sine qua non for winning the Nobel Prize, and it closely correlates with the number of Nobel laureates in each country ..."*

## Planning a sampling {.smaller}

<div style="border: 2px solid #e74c3c; background-color: #fdecea; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  ⚠️ <strong>Key question</strong> <br> What is the best way to sample my population in a _representative_ way?
</div>

<br><br>

* Do it _randomly_ to avoid any intentional or unintentional bias (**Randomized Sampling**)
* Take into account known subpopulations and confounding factors (**Stratified Random Sampling**)
* The number of samples is determined by practical/economical considerations

In presence of known subpopulations stratified random sampling results in a more accurate characterization of the population

## Stratified Random Sampling

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="60%"}
include_graphics("../images/Stratified_sampling.png")
```

## Key idea: do it randomly

The most reasonable way to "smear out" the effects of unknown biases is to do everything **randomly**

`r text_spec("Random is not a synonym of HAPHAZARD", color = "red")`

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="40%"}
include_graphics("../images/Random-Numbers-Cloud.png")
```

## Planning an observational study

<div style="border: 2px solid #e74c3c; background-color: #fdecea; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  <strong>Objective:</strong> get an useful and clear answer.
  
  <strong>Mean:</strong> start from a clear, useful and often simple question.
</div>

<br><br>

* Identify the **sampling unit**
* Decide the number of samples (money, power, ...)
* Define the conceptual population
* Sample it in a representative way
* Identify **confounding factors** and, if possible, **stratify** for them 


## Key idea: Sampling Unit
The smaller unit of a population which retains the properties we are interested into


* *Example: grapevine, leafs, infections ...*


## Key idea: Confounding Factor

A variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable, causing a spurious association (*wikipedia*).

* *Smoke, cardiovascular disease, alcohol consumption*
* *Birth order (1st child, 2nd child, etc.), maternal age, Down Syndrome in the child*

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="40%"}
include_graphics("../images/Confounding.png")
```


## Notes

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">

* Some confounders can be controlled by careful sampling 
  * Eg. *Age and Gender on the relation between happiness and chocolate*
* Some others are impossible to control 
  * Eg. *Presence of chemical pollution in the water streams and altitude of sampling*


  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1;">
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="70%"}
  include_graphics("../images/fieldnotes.jpg")
```
  </div>
</div>



## Planning one experiment

<div style="border: 2px solid #e74c3c; background-color: #fdecea; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  <strong>Objective:</strong> get an useful and clear answer.
  
  <strong>Mean:</strong> start from a clear, useful and often simple question.
</div>

<br><br>

* What is my **experimental unit**?
* How many samples should I measure?
* What are the **potential sources of variability**?

## Experimental Design

<div style="border: 2px solid #e74c3c; background-color: #fdecea; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  ⚠️ <strong>Definition</strong> <br> A strategy to assign the experimental units to the different *treatments* to optimize my capacity of inferring **causal relationships**
</div>

<br><br>

`r text_spec("Control of unwanted sources of variability (technical/biological) to highlight the effects of the intervention", color = "red")`


## Key tool : Blocking {.smaller}

* Group experimental units in homogeneous groups (blocks)
* Study the variability inside the blocks
* Identify and subtract the variability across the blocks
* Blocking allows to *subtract* the difference between the blocks
* Blocks and study factors should be *orthogonal*


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("../images/blocks.png")
```

`r text_spec("Block what you can; randomize what you cannot ...", color = "red", bold = TRUE)`



## Examples of common blocking factors


<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">

* Location  
* Analytical batch
* Day
* Operator 
* ...

</div>

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="70%"}
  include_graphics("../images/usual_suspects.jpg")
```
  </div>
</div>

```


## Split Plot Designs

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("../images/exp_des_2.png")
```


## Longitudinal Studies

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("../images/exp_des_3.png")
```


## Crossover Studies

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("../images/exp_des_4.png")
```


## Notes

## Notes

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 30px;">
<div style="flex: 1;">

* Block as much as possible!
* Repeated measures are more "powerful" because each unit is the control of itself
* Crossovers can be tricky for the wash-out
* Repeated measures design are the key in presence of large variability in the population (e.g. plants in the field/greenhouse)
