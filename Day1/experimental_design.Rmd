## Statistics

**Statistics** is the science which deals with **the collection, the analysis, the visualization and the interpretation** of experimental data

* random sampling
* observational studies
* experiments


## Random Samplings (polls)

Random sapling allow to characterize the properties of a finite population without measuring all of its members

**Examples**

* *Electoral polls*
* *Normal levels of cholesterol in the human population*
* ...

## Observational Studies

Observational studies are designed with tho objective of **identifying relationships** between the different properties of a conceptual population. The role of the experimenter is to perform the **selection of the sample**

<hr>

**Examples**

>* *Is it true that people who eat more chocolate are more happy?*
>* *The level of cholesterol of people eating more vegetables is lower*
>* ...

## Experiments

**Experiments** are designed with the objective of identifying **causal relations** between the properties of a conceptual population. The role of the experimenter is to **modify the conditions** to verify the presence of causal relationship between the observed properties

<hr>

**Examples**

>* *If you eat more chocolate you will get happier*
>* *If I drink more beer I'll get more sympathetic*
>* ...


## Imortant notes

* Causal relations can be assessed only in **experiments**
* This is really Galileian ;-)
* Experiments are impossible in many relevant fields ... human health, ecology

<hr>

<div class="red2">
* Should we then give up on obtaining causal information?

<hr>

*~~Chocolate consumption enhances cognitive function, which is a sine qua non for winning the Nobel Prize, and it closely correlates with the number of Nobel laureates in each country~~*

## Planning a sampling

**Key question**: what is the best way to sample my population in a _representative_ way?

* Do it _randomly_ to avoid any intentional or unintentional bias (**Randomized Sampling**)
* Take into account known subpopulations (**Stratified Random Sampling**)
* Take into account known confounding factors (**Blocking**)
* The number of samples is determined by practical/economical considerations

In presence of known subpopulations stratified random sampling result in a more accurate characterization of the population

## Planning an observational study

**Objective**: get a useful and clear answer

**Mean**: start from a clear, useful and often simple question

* Identify the **sampling unit**
* Define the conceptual population
* Can I sample it in a representative way?
* Plan a clever sampling ...
* Identify **confounding factors** and stratify the sampling


## Key idea #1: Sampling Unit
The smaller unit of a population which retains the properties we are interested into.


## Key idea #2: Confounding Factor

In statistics, a confounder (also confounding variable, confounding factor, or lurking variable) is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable, causing a spurious association. Confounding is a causal concept, and as such, cannot be described in terms of correlations or associations. (*wikipedia*)

* Smoke, cardiovascular disease, alcohol consumption
* Birth order (1st child, 2nd child, etc.), presence of Down Syndrome in the child, maternal age

## Planning one experiment

**Objective**: get a useful and clear answer

**Mean**: start from a clear, useful and often simple question

* What is my experimental unit?
* How many samples should I measure?
* What are the potential sources of variability?

## Experimental Design

A strategy to assign the experimental units to the different *treatments* to optimize my capacity of inferring **causal relationships**

* Control of unwanted sources of variability (technical/biological)

## Key idea #3: Blocking

* Group experimental units in homogeneous groups (blocks)
* Study the variability inside the blocks
* Identify and subtract the variability across the blocks
* Blocking allows to "subtract" the difference between the blocks
* Blocks and study factors should be *orthogonal*

**Block what you can; randomize what you cannot.**



*~~Blocking is better than randomization because it is possible to "subtract" the variability between the blocks~~*

**Examples of common blocking factors:**

* Location  
* Analytical batch
* Day
* Operator
