## What is Metabolomics

The objective of ~~metabolomics~~ is to characterize in the most complete and comprehensive way the pool of small molecules which are the end product of the metabolism.

The pool of these molecules is known as ~~metabolome~~. 

Metabolomics aims at measuring the metabolites in a ~~quantitative~~ way and to characterize their relations and associations.


## Why Metabolomics 

> 1. For the quest of ~~molecular markers~~ (_e.g. nutrition, health, cancer_ )
> 2. To perform ~~molecular phenotyping~~ (_e.g. personalized medicine_)
> 3. To associate a ~~genes~~ to its ~~function~~ (_e.g. to support breeding_)
> 4. To study the ~~chemical interaction~~ in complex systems (_e.g. ecological interaction are often mediated by chemicals_) 


## Challenges of Metabolomics {.smaller .build}

### 1 - ~~Size~~ of the metabolic chemical space
The molecules included in the metabolome can be extremely diverse in particular if plants/microorganisms are concerned.

### 2 - Diversity in the ~~chemical properties~~ of the metabolites
The chemical diversity results in different properties which would require different methods of analysis.

### 3 - Huge differences in ~~concentrations~~
Some of the metabolite are present in high concentration, while other highly relevant compounds are present only in small traces. Our analytical method should be able to ~~see them at the same time~~.


## Challenges of Metabolomics cont ...{.smaller .build}

### 4. - ~~Coverage~~
The chemical diversity makes extremely difficult to have only **one** analytical method able to analyze everything.

### 5. - ~~Pre analytics~~
The approach is so sensitive that every un reproducible pre-analytical issue will affect the data.

## How Metabolomics

We need an analytic technique:

> 1. Sensitive to the **chemical structure**.
> 2. **Universal** - able to see almost all classes of molecules.
> 3. **Sensitive** - able to see metabolites with low concentrations.
> 4. With an high **dynamic range** - able to measure at the same time low and high abundant compounds.

```

## Molecules and features

In all the techniques presented so far, ~~each metabolite~~ give rise to a large set of ~~different signals~~: 

* **MS** - the different ions produced in the ionization of the metabolite.
* **NMR** - the different peaks coming from the resonance of the nuclei present in the molecule.
* **LC/GC-MS** - the different ions which are eluting at different time. These mz/rt couples are called *features*

  ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Warning:</strong> All the variables coming from the same molecule are ~~highly correlated~~.
</div>

## Sources of Analytical Variability {.smaller}

### 1 - The measurement itself
Even with the perfect instrument the "numbers" will change. Try measuring your temperature 10 times in a row ;-)

### 2 - Chromatographic drifts
When chromatographic separation is present, elution times will slightly change from run to run. For GC the situation is better, but far from being perfect



## Sources of Analytical Variability {.smaller}

### 3 - Matrix effects
In metabolomics we are loading on the instruments a complex mixture of chemicals. This complex chemical environment will affect the _response_ of the molecules in an often unpredictable way. The importance of this effect is so strong in MS that this technique is almost always coupled with chromatography

With chromatography the different molecules reach the ionization source at different times, reducing the matrix effect.

### 4 - Sample handling
The approach is so powerful that all aspect related to sample handling/storage/extraction will affect the final result 


## NMR vs LC/GC MS {.build}

### NMR
> 1. üòÄ Reproducible
> 2. üòÄ Inherently quantitative
> 3. üòÄ Sensitive to the chemical structure
> 4. üòû Relatively insensitive
> 5. üòû Dynamic range

### LC/GC - MS
> 1. üòÄ Sensitive
> 2. üòÄ Universal
> 3. üòÄ With high dynamic range
> 3. üòû Less reproducible (üòâ)

# Doing Metabolomics

## Targeted vs Untargeted {.smaller .build}

### Targeted
We use the analytical method of choice to analyze a selected set of metabolites. The list can go from around 10 to something around 500.  

~~The measured variables are metabolites~~

<div style="border: 2px solid #e74c3c; background-color: #fdecea; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Warning:</strong> The numbers we collect is the concentration of the individual metabolites.
</div>




### Untargeted
We "throw" a raw sample in our instrument, trying to analyze as much signals as possible. How many things we are able to see is unknown. 

~~The measured variables are **not** metabolites~~

<div style="border: 2px solid #e74c3c; background-color: #fdecea; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Warning:</strong> The numbers we get are the peak areas of the individual features.
</div>




## Why targeted, why untargeted {.smaller .build }

### Targeted

> 1. üòÄ ~~quantitative~~ results are obtained "by definition"
> 2. üòÄ results can be interpreted under the light of the ~~known metabolic pathways~~
> 3. üòÄ the analytical results are ~~comparable~~ across experiments and across laboratories (aka limited _batch effect_) 
> 4. üòû we basically look only to the expected

### Untargeted

> 1. üòÄ ~~holistic~~
> 2. üòÄ open to ~~unexpected~~
> 3. üòû tricky
> 4. üòû hardly quantitative
> 5. üòû not standardized


## The ideal Metabolomics road-map

include_graphics("../images/workflow.png")
```

# Pitfalls and caveats

## Poor planning {.build }

_~~Aka ... I have a refrigerator of samples ... shall we give a look?~~_

> 1. Unclear scientific question
> 2. Suboptimal experimental design (no replicates, no proper definition of the study factors)
> 2. Erratic analytical planning (unreliable sample extraction, disorganized analytical runs)
> 4. ... 

Remember that ~~instruments are sensitive~~, so errors will unavoidably show-up in the final data (_garbage in, garbage out_)

## Annotation ...

```{r out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("../images/annotation.png")
```


## Annotation in Untargeted Metabolomics

As you have already understood, in untargeted metabolomics:

- We do not measure the concentration of metabolites
- If I have the metabolite is easier to understand what are the signals we actually measure (ions, NMR peaks, features)
- ... the reverse (called ~~annotation~~) is not at all trivial

_~~Chemical annotation is the current bottleneck in untargeted metabolomics~~_

## Annotation strategies {.build}

> * Fragmentation experiments (in MS!)
> * In house db of standards
> * On-line db of standards
> * Chemoinformatics
> * ML (prediction of chemical structures from spectra)


## Sampling and sample handling {.build}

> - The analytical techniques used in metabolomics are extremely sensitive
> - More often than not the samples are complex mixtures of chemicals
> - Poor preparation, handling and storage will hamper the overall investigation

_e.g. how to sample in a representative way in GC? How to quench the metabolism of microorganisms? how to store biofluids?_ 

## Statistical Validation {.build}

> 1. Unfavorable variables-to-samples ratio
> 2. Unexpected subpopulations
> 3. Not always easy to place the results inside the established body of knowledge

**~~Two stage design:~~** 

1. Hypothesis generation
2. Validation

## Domain Specific Validation

Are my results fitting inside the established (domain specific) body of knowledge?


_e.g. Are my markers reasonable under the light of the human metabolism?_
