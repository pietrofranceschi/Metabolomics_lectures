## What is `xcms` {.smaller}

Framework for processing and visualization of chromatographically separated and single-spectra mass spectral data.

[xcms](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html)

and still growing ...

[RforMassSpectrometry](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/)

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=2, fig.width=3, out.width="70%"}
p1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("../images/compoundDB.png", scale = 0.6)
p2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("../images/spectra.png", scale = 0.6)

plot_grid(p1, p2)
```

## The data matrix

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("../images/Matrix.svg")
```

## The role of Data Analysis

Statistics, Bionformatics, Machine Learning, Chemometrics, ..., provide the tools to:

-   make science shared and reproducible ... ;-)
-   process and organize **big data** into the matrix
-   identify the presence of **organization** in the data matrix
-   assess the confidence that our result is true "at the population level"

## Examples of Organization

```{r fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}

a <- tibble(class = rep(c("A","B"), each = 100),
       intensity = c(rnorm(100,10), rnorm(100,11))) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_jitter(aes(x = class, y = intensity, col = class), width = 0.1) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)


b <- tibble(met_a = runif(20,0,10)) %>%
  mutate(noise = rnorm(20)) %>% 
  mutate(met_b = met_a*2 + noise) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = met_a, y = met_b), col = "steelblue", size = 2) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)


b|a

```



## False Positives {.build}

> * Organization can show up only by chance
> * These results are *true*, but the hold only for the data we are analyzing now
> * Organization is not necessarily science
> * Variability causes this
> * We need to *validate* our outcomes


## On Validation {.build}

> * **Statistical Validation**: get brand new samples and see if what we get is still there
> * **Domain Validation**: is what I'm getting in keeping with the domain specific body of knowledge? Could I design an experiment to check my hypothesis?

> #### Do we always need statistics?

## Data hygiene {.build}

> * Go for a scripting language and forget Excel
> * ... at least use a gui pipeline or a web based solution
> * Organize data and metadata
> * Avoid as much as possible *manual curation*
> * Share your data, your scripts, your results
> * Go open source

## Get out your data

* Metabolomics data are always stored in "formats" which are specifically developed by instrument vendors
* In the case of MS data several open source standards are available (cdf, mzML, mzIML, ...)

[Proteowizard](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/)

* command line tool
* gui application
* docker with proprietary libraries

## LC-MS For Dummies

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("../images/LCMS.jpg")
```

## Analytical Variability in LC-MS | Mass

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("../images/mass_drift.png")
```

## Analytical Variability in LC-MS |Retention time

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

fnames <- list.files("../data/SpikedApples/control/","CDF", full.names = TRUE)

apples <- readMSData(fnames, mode = "onDisk") 

```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bpi <- apples %>% filterRt(c(250,410)) %>% chromatogram(aggregationFun = "max")
```

```{r fig.align='center', out.width="80%", fig.height=6}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-align: center

plot(bpi, col = "steelblue", main = "BPI")
```


## Analytical Variability in LC-MS| Intensity

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("../images/Total_ion_current.png")
```


## Preprocessing {.build}


> * I call **preprocessing** all the data carpentry steps I do to go from the raw experimental data to the data matrix
> * The aim of this process is to compensate for *analytical variability* being able to reliably build a data matrix
> * *QC samples* play a big role on that because they are sensitive only to analytical variability


## Uses of QCs 

*QCs should be representative of the chemical complexity of your samples*

* correct for retention time shifts
* identify [reliable]{style="color: red"} variables:
   * variance in QC should be smaller than in samples
   * they should decrease during dilution
   *    ...
* help in correcting for bath effects ...

## LC-MS produces 3D data  | (rt,mz,I) {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("../images/LCMS_data.png")
```


**Things too look at**

* Extracted Ion Trace/Current (EIT/EIC)
* Mass Spectra

## Extracted ion traces

```{r fig.align='center', out.width="80%", fig.height=6}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-align: center

register(SerialParam())
proc_trace <- chromatogram(apples %>% filterRt(c(100,500)), mz = 577.13 + c(-1,1)*0.01)
plot(proc_trace, col = "coral")
```

## Mass Spectra

```{r fig.align='center', out.width="80%", fig.height=6} 

#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-align: center


ms <- apples[[1000]]

tibble(mz =  mz(ms), i = intensity(ms)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = mz, xend = mz, y = 0, yend = i)) + 
  theme_bw()



```

## Back to Raw data

Always check your results on the raw data

* problems in preprocessing
* bad peaks
* biomarkers
* results hidden in noise

# Peak Picking

## Peaks and metabolites: facts {.build}

> * A **metabolite produces peaks** in the extracted ion traces of its associated ions
> * Different peaks in the same ion chromatograms are associated to different metabolites
> * **Peaks are not metabolites**
> * The same peak can slightly **move** across the injections

<hr>

>  **We need an automatic method to look for peaks**

## Things to always consider {.build}

> * Every algorithm has parameters to tune!
> * Look to the data!
> * Know how the instrument works
> * Check what happens to metabolites you know should be there

# Retention time correction and feature definition

## ... Just a recap

1.  We converted the data files in an open source format (here mzML)
2.  We optimized the peak picking parameters working on a representative sample (Qc)
3.  We have been running peak picking on the full set of samples
4.  We have been saving the output somewhere, just to avoid re-starting from scratch ;-)

## What Next

We have to merge the lists of [chromatographic peaks]{style="color: red"} into a consensus list of [ features peaks]{style="color: red"}, which will be the columns of our data matrix

* *chromatographich peaks* what was detected in the individual samples (mz,rt,intensity)
* *features* consensus variables which are *grouping* several peaks coming from the different injections (mz,rt, intensity)

## Dynamic Time Warping {.build}

## RT Checks {.flexbox .vcenter}

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("../images/rt_shift.png")
```


## Things to always consider 

-   Aligning samples and not QCs can be tricky
-   Some metabolites could not be present in pooled QC (dilutions)
-   Sometimes chromatographic peaks are missed
-   Always check the data and the known peaks!
-   Parameters are easier to tune if you know how the analytics works
-   Rt shifts should be smaller than peak width


## NAssss NAssss

Even if you do everything well your final data matrix will be full of missing values:

-   errors in peak picking
-   "absence" of a metabolite in one or more samples (biology)
-   that metabolite is below the detection limit (analytics)

<hr>


-   missing at random
-   missing not at random

# Fragmentation Data

## Annotation and MS {.build}

> * At the end of the journey we would like to work on *metabolites* or *pathways* and not on features
> * We know that **annotation** is the most challenging step of all the business
> * The more we know about the structure of our ions the better it is
> * Database of standards, web resources, chemoinformatics, ...
> * **Fragmentation patterns are extremely useful**

## MS/MS and DDA

*DDA*: Data Dependent Acquisition

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("../images/tandemMS.jpg")
```


## Notes

* `xcms` allows also to handle fragmentation experiments
* `xcms` ecosystem is growing towards databases of spectra
* As we already discussed, do not be too optimistic with complex MS experiments
* Sometimes the ion you are interested was not fragmented (plan a specific run!)
