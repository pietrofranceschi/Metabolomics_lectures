## Intro

Many of the steps we have been discussing today are common to almost all software solutions availabe for tha analysis of metabolomics data:

1. Commercial suites
2. Open source solution run locally (e.g. `xcms`)
3. Freely available web services


## `XCMS` Online

### 1 - Allow the use of xcms through a web interface

[`xcms` online](https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/landing_page.php?pgcontent=mainPage)

### 2 - Allows to use Galaxy
The french metabolomics network also provide software for pathway analysis and visualization

[`Metabohub` - Workflow-4-metabolomics](https://workflow4metabolomics.org/)

## R based analysis

### Linked to the Human Metabolome Database
MetaboAnalyst	- statistical, functional and integrative analysis of metabolomics data

[`Metaboanalyst`](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/)

## Without R

### Python Based
As part of the deNBI Center for integrative Bioinformatics, OpenMS offers an open-source software C++ library (+ python bindings) for LC/MS data management and analyses

[`OpenMS`](https://www.openms.de/)

### In Galaxy and Knime
KNIME Analytics Platform is the open source software for creating data science

[`knime`](https://www.knime.com/)

## The Phenomenal Project
PhenoMeNal (Phenome and Metabolome aNalysis) is a comprehensive and standardised e-infrastructure that supports the data processing and analysis pipelines for molecular phenotype data generated by metabolomics applications
