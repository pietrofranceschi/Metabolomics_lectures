## Starting Ideas {#notes }

>1. Metabolites shows up as peaks in the rt/mz space
>2. Each metabolites produces more than one peak
>3. The peaks of the same compounds are slightly shifted in the  different samples


## Fragmentation

During ionization chemical structures ~~fragment~~ in different ions

```


## Pre processing workflow

0. Get out the raw data
1. Reliably find peaks in the 2D plane for each sample
2. Align the different peak lists 
3. Match the peak lists across the samples
3. Select a good measure of intensity and arrange everything in a data matrix


<br>

**Provide reliable ways to visualize all the previous steps and check their consistency**

## Visualization

- Inspecting and checking the quality of each step
- Checking the outcomes of the statistical analysis

<hr>


~~A result should be visible in the raw data ...~~



## 0. Get the raw data

Raw LC/Gc-MS are saved in **proprietary** format by the acquisition equipment (Bruker, Agilent, thermo, Waters, ...). 

Before the analysis the raw data have to be **converted** into _open source_ formats:

- mzData
- cdf
- mzXML
- **mzML** , more recent and recommended

# 1. Peak Picking

## General Ideas

Almost all software for the analysis of untargeted metabolomics data will propose different algorithms to perform peak picking:

* None of the algorithms is perfect
* There are a lot of parameters to tweak
* The practice (and **the awareness**) makes the master



## Matched Filter

```


## Cent-Wave

```{r fig.align="center", out.width="60%"}

```


## Finding the best parameters

* Look for molecules ~~you know~~ should be there
* ~~Visually Check~~ your output
* Do no look for _perfection_

# 2. Alignment

## General Ideas

In a multi sample experiment ~~peak lists~~ are

* different even if we analyze the same sample twice
* they are different for ananlytical/instrumental reasons
* they are different for biological reasons.

<hr>

The objective of alignment is to **compensate** the analytical drifts, without putting together things that should not be aligned

# 3. Correspondance

## General Ideas

The last step is to find a consensus list of variable across the different samples. After alignment, the list of peaks is now aligned in retention time but:

* peak lists are still separated per sample
* a peak could be present only in a group of samples (because a metabolite is missing there)
* a peak could be missing because it was not correctly identified

## Density Based Grouping

```{r fig.align="center", out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("../images/grouping.png")
```


## Features and Peaks

* ~~Peaks~~: show up in each sample at a specific time during chromatography due to the ionization of a metabolite
* ~~Features~~: are consensus variables which group together different peaks 


# 3. Get the DM

## MMeasuring Intensity

The actual signal intensity of each chromatographic peak (and then of each feature) can be characterized:

* by the area of the peak
* by the maximal intensity of the signal
* by the area of the filter used to find the peak

The ~~area~~ is often more robust, but can give erratic results if the peak is not well defined. The ~~max~~ intensity can be erratic. The signal of the filter is rarely used
